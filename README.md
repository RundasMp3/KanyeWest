# KanyeWest
Kanye West (abbreviated as KW) is a Virtual Machine whose purpose is to run bytecode executables generated from an Penguinese compiler. This VM allows loading programs and supports all instructions seen on x69 (See documentation folder to find more information about x69 and Penguinese.)

The name comes from Kanye West being one of the greatest musicians of this era, hence why we're also creating one of the greatest VMs seen on this class.

Current capabilites:
- Basic Math operations

TODO:
- Everything else

Once it's finished, Kanye West will be able to:
- Interpret bytecode fully
- Execute functions, cycles and conditionals
- Allow variables of decimal, integer, string and characters to be input on the program
- All this from the command line!
